Here's a brief summary of what you learned in this session: 

Machine learning models can be classified into following two categories on the basis of learning algorithm:
Supervised learning method: Past data with labels is available to build the model
Regression: The output variable is continuous in nature
Classification: The output variable is categorical in nature
Unsupervised learning method: Past data with labels are not available
Clustering: No pre-defined notion of labels is there
Past data set is divided into two parts during supervised learning method: 
Training data  is used for the model to learn during modelling
Testing data is used by the trained model for prediction and model evaluation
Linear regression models can be classified into two types depending upon the number of independent variables: 
Simple linear regression: When the number of independent variables is 1
Multiple linear regression: When the number of independent variables is more than 1
The equation of the best fit regression line Y = β₀ + β₁X can be found by minimising the cost function (RSS in this case, using the Ordinary Least Squares method) which is done using the following two methods:
Differentiation
Gradient descent method
The strength of a linear regression model is mainly explained by R²,  where R² = 1 - (RSS / TSS)
RSS: Residual Sum of Squares
TSS: Total Sum of Squares
